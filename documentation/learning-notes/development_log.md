## ðŸ§  Technical Learning Insights

### **Embedded Programming Patterns**
- **Memory Management**: Flipper Zero has strict memory constraints
- **Real-time Constraints**: UI must be responsive, no blocking operations
- **Hardware Abstraction**: FuriOS provides abstraction over hardware peripherals
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Callback-based UI and input handling

### **Flipper Zero Architecture**
- **Application Types**: External apps vs system apps
- **Resource Management**: Careful allocation and cleanup required
- **Graphics System**: Canvas-based drawing with primitive operations
- **Input System**: Event-driven button and navigation handling

### **Development Workflow**
- **Build System**: FBT (Flipper Build Tool) for compilation and flashing
- **Debugging**: UART logging and LED indicators for troubleshooting
- **Testing**: Systematic testing on hardware vs emulation
- **Documentation**: Code comments + external documentation for learning

## ðŸ”§ Technical Decisions Log

### **Architecture Choices**

#### **Development Environment**
- **Decision**: PopOS main workstation vs Raspberry Pi development
- **Rationale**: Faster compilation and better IDE support for iteration speed
- **Trade-offs**: Less embedded-native environment but better development experience
- **Status**: âœ… Decided - PopOS main workstation

#### **Repository Structure**
- **Decision**: Monorepo vs separate repositories
- **Rationale**: Easier code sharing between Flipper and ESP32 development
- **Trade-offs**: Larger repository but better organization for cross-platform work
- **Status**: âœ… Decided - Monorepo approach

#### **AI Integration Strategy**
- **Decision**: Transparent AI collaboration with systematic documentation
- **Rationale**: Aligns with QRY methodology and PostHog's "vibe coding with AI agents"
- **Trade-offs**: More documentation overhead but demonstrates systematic AI usage
- **Status**: âœ… Decided - Full transparency approach

### **Technical Stack**

#### **Flipper Zero Development**
- **Language**: C (Flipper Zero native)
- **Framework**: FuriOS + Flipper SDK
- **Build System**: FBT (Flipper Build Tool)
- **Testing**: Hardware testing + systematic documentation

#### **ESP32-S3 Development**
- **Language**: C++ (Arduino framework)
- **Framework**: Arduino IDE + PlatformIO
- **Build System**: Arduino build system or PlatformIO
- **Testing**: Hardware testing + unit testing where possible
