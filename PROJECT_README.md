## 🎯 What is This Project?

This is a **systematic embedded development project** building a PostHog DeskHog from scratch. It's designed to be the perfect demonstration of technical capability for a PostHog application - combining hardware engineering, game development, AI collaboration, and authentic community contribution.

**Why DeskHog?** It showcases every skill PostHog values: embedded programming, educational game design, AI-enhanced development, open source contribution, and the cultural "weird" factor that makes PostHog special.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Hardware**: Flipper Zero + WiFi Dev Board (ESP32-S2) + Game Module
- **System**: PopOS/Ubuntu Linux (other distros may work with modifications)
- **Time**: 2 hours for initial setup, then daily iteration cycles

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone git@github.com:QRY91/deskhog_build.git
cd deskhog_build
```

### 2. Install Flipper Zero Toolchain
```bash
# Run comprehensive setup script
./tools/build-scripts/setup_flipper_dev.sh

# Activate development environment
source ~/activate-flipper-env.sh
```

### 3. Build and Test First App
```bash
# Build the QRY Hello app
./tools/build-scripts/build_qry_hello.sh build

# Flash to connected Flipper Zero
./tools/build-scripts/build_qry_hello.sh flash
```

### 4. Start Developing
```bash
# Create your own app based on the template
cp -r flipper-zero/qry-hello flipper-zero/my-app
# Edit and build with the same script pattern
```

## 🗺️ Embedded Development Mental Model

### **Traditional Software Dev** vs **Flipper Zero Embedded**

```bash
# Traditional Web/Desktop
Source Code (.js/.py/.cpp) → Build System → Executable → Run locally

# Flipper Zero Embedded  
Source Code (.c) → FBT Build → .fap Package → Flash to Hardware
```

### **Key Components**

#### **1. Source Code** 
- **File**: `qry_hello.c` (standard C code)
- **What it is**: Your application logic, UI, input handling
- **Familiar**: Just like any C program, but with Flipper-specific APIs

#### **2. Build System**
- **Tool**: FBT (Flipper Build Tool) - like npm/webpack/cmake for Flipper
- **Input**: Your .c file + application.fam (manifest)
- **Output**: `.fap` file (Flipper Application Package)

#### **3. Package Format**
- **File**: `qry_hello.fap` (2.8KB binary)
- **What it is**: Think "APK for Android" or "executable for embedded"
- **Contains**: Compiled code + metadata + resources

#### **4. Deployment**
- **Method**: USB flash via FBT or manual SD card copy
- **Target**: Flipper's SD card `/ext/apps/` directory
- **Runtime**: Runs on Flipper's ARM processor with 512KB RAM

### **Development Cycle**

```bash
# 1. Edit source
vim flipper-zero/qry-hello/qry_hello.c

# 2. Build & Deploy (one command)
./tools/build-scripts/build_qry_hello.sh flash

# 3. Test on hardware
# App launches automatically on Flipper

# 4. Iterate
# Modify code, repeat cycle
```

### **Key Differences from Traditional Dev**

| Aspect | Traditional | Flipper Zero |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Runtime** | Your OS | Embedded ARM + FuriOS |
| **Resources** | GB RAM/disk | 512KB RAM, limited storage |
| **APIs** | OS libs | Flipper SDK (graphics, input, etc) |
| **Testing** | Local run | Flash to hardware |
| **Distribution** | App stores | .fap files on SD card |

### **Mental Model: "It's Like Mobile Development"**

Think of it as:
- **Flipper Zero** = Your phone
- **.fap file** = APK/IPA package  
- **SD card** = App installation
- **FBT** = Android Studio build system
- **USB flash** = ADB install
