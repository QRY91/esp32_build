## 🎯 Budget Optimization Strategies

### **Phase 1: Minimal Viable Investment**
**Start with**: $48 (WiFi dev board + basics)  
**Goal**: Validate technical feasibility on Flipper Zero  
**Decision point**: Only proceed to Phase 2 if prototype succeeds

### **Phase 2: Incremental Hardware**
**Buy as needed**: Spread $105 over 4 weeks  
**Test before investing**: Validate each component works before buying next  
**Reuse components**: Many parts useful for future embedded projects

### **Cost Control Measures**
- **3D printing**: Use library/makerspace instead of buying printer ($12 vs $200+)
- **Components**: Buy from China (longer shipping, 50% cost reduction)
